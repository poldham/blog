      <title>Creating A Bibliography with rcrossref</title>

      <description>In this article we will look at how to create a bibliography using the rcrossref package in R with RStudio. To help us get started we will also look at how to reference any R packages that you use in your work with knitr. The article is part of work in progress for the WIPO Handbook on Patent Analytics. Comments and suggestions are welcome.
Many of us will have spent an unreasonable amount of our time struggling to create bibliographies for a thesis, publication or reports.</description>

      <title>Counting Patent First Filings the Tidy Way with R</title>
      <link>https://www.pauloldham.net/counting-patent-first-filings/</link>

      <guid>https://www.pauloldham.net/counting-patent-first-filings/</guid>
      <description>This article provides an in depth introduction to counting patent first filings or priority counts. It is a work in progress chapter for the WIPO Patent Analytics Handbook focusing on advanced patent analytics and builds on the introductory WIPO Manual on Open Source Patent Analytics.
Counting first filings is an important subject for patent statistics because the first filing of a patent application marks the date that is closest to investment in research and development leading to the invention.</description>

      <description>Introduction Import Directly from the RStudio Menu Reading an Excel file from a URL Tidying column names with janitor Exporting to Excel Round Up   Introduction Back in 2015 I wrote a long blog post on importing Excel tables into R. Happily for everyone this is now a lot easier than it was. This post provides an update on importing spreadsheets into R and exporting from R to Excel.</description>

      <title>Dr. Evil meets the robotstxt package</title>
      <link>https://www.pauloldham.net/using-robotstxt-in-r/</link>

      <description>I am fairly new to webscraping in R using rvest and one question is whether a site gives permission for scraping. This information is often contained in the robots.txt file on a website. So, I’m briefly going to explore the ROpenSci robotstxt package by Peter Meissner. robotstxt provides easy access to the robots.txt file for a domain from R.
I’m slowly working on a new R data package for underwater geographic feature names as part of a Norwegian Research Council funded project biospolar on innovation involving biodiversity in marine polar areas.</description>

      <title>Creating an Infographic with infogram</title>
      <link>https://www.pauloldham.net/infographics/</link>

      <guid>https://www.pauloldham.net/infographics/</guid>
      <description>In this article we will use RStudio to prepare patent data for visualisation in an infographic using the online software tool infogram.
Infographics are a popular way of presenting data in a way that is easy for a reader to understand without reading a long report. Infographics are well suited to presenting summaries of data with simple messages about key findings. A good infographic can encourage the audience to read a detailed report and is a tool for engagement with audiences during presentations of the findings of patent research.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scientific Literature with rplos</title>
      <link>https://www.pauloldham.net/rplos-walkthrough/</link>

      <guid>https://www.pauloldham.net/rplos-walkthrough/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In this chapter we look at the use of the rplos package from rOpenSci to access the scientific literature from the Public Library of Science using the PLOS Search API.
The Public Library of Science (PLOS) is the main champion of open access peer reviewed scientific publications and has published somewhere in the region of 140,000 articles. These articles are a fantastic resource. PLOS includes the following titles.
 PLOS ONE PLOS Biology PLOS Medicine PLOS Computational Biology PLOS Genetics PLOS Pathogens PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases PLOS Clinical Trials () PLOS Collections (collections of articles)  PLOS is important because it provides open access to the full text of peer reviewed research.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this article we provide a brief introduction to The Lens patent database as a free source of data for patent analytics.
The Lens is a patent database based in Australia that describes itself as “an open global cyberinfrastructure to make the innovation system more efficient and fair, more transparent and inclusive.” The main way it seeks to do this is by providing access to patent information with a particular focus on sequence information as well as analysis of issues such as DNA related patent activity.</description>

      <description>This post was updated in 2018 and you can read it here
The CRAN Project has the following to say about importing Excel files into R.
“The first piece of advice is to avoid doing so if possible! If you have access to Excel, export the data you want from Excel in tab-delimited or comma-separated form, and use read.delim or read.csv to import it into R. (You may need to use read.</description>
