      <description>In this article we will look at geocoding using the Google Maps API and the placement, ggmap, and googleway packages in R. We will work with some raw data from Clarivate Analytics Web of Science (formerly Thomson Reuters) database of scientific literature. Many universities have access to Web of Science and it is a very important tool in fields such as bibliometrics/scientometrics. This article is part of work in progress for the WIPO Patent Analytics Handbook that addresses methods for advanced patent analytics including linking the scientific literature with patent literature.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this chapter we look at the use of the rplos package from rOpenSci to access the scientific literature from the Public Library of Science using the PLOS Search API.
The Public Library of Science (PLOS) is the main champion of open access peer reviewed scientific publications and has published somewhere in the region of 140,000 articles. These articles are a fantastic resource. PLOS includes the following titles.
 PLOS ONE PLOS Biology PLOS Medicine PLOS Computational Biology PLOS Genetics PLOS Pathogens PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases PLOS Clinical Trials () PLOS Collections (collections of articles)  PLOS is important because it provides open access to the full text of peer reviewed research.</description>
