      <description>I have been planning to transfer my existing Jekyll based blog over to blogdown and Hugo for quite a while. Having spent most of last year hopping on and off aeroplanes this had turned into an epic fail. Christmas seemed like a good time to fix that.
The blogdown package from Yihui Xie generates a Go based Hugo blog. Once you have installed blogdown and followed the nice and friendly instructions in the blogdown book you should be ready to go.</description>
