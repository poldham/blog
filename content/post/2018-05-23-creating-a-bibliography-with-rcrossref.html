<p>In this article we will look at how to create a bibliography using the <code>rcrossref</code> package in R with RStudio. To help us get started we will also look at how to reference any R packages that you use in your work with <code>knitr</code>. The article is part of work in progress for the WIPO Handbook on Patent Analytics. Comments and suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>Many of us will have spent an unreasonable amount of our time struggling to create bibliographies for a thesis, publication or reports. Software such as Endnote (Clarivate Analytics), Mendeley (Elsevier) and Zotero provide options for creating and managing bibliographic data. From experience, this generally involves masses of hours fiddling around with reference formats and so on before and after submission for publication.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a> is a non-profit organisation that provides metadata on over 96 million publications in the form of information on the authors, titles, organisations, funding and so on. It is not a full text database but is increasingly providing access to abstracts and links to full texts.</p>
<p>Crossref can be accessed through an <a href="https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc">API</a>. For R users, Scott Chamberlain, Carl Boettiger, Ted Hart and Karthik Ram have developed the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref">rcrossref</a> package as part of the ever growing suite of <a href="https://ropensci.org/">ROpenSci</a> packages.</p>
<p>To get started we will install the packages we are going to need and then look at how to quickly create a bibliography file for packages we are going to use. Once we have a grip on that we will use <code>rcrossref</code>.</p>
<div id="packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Packages</h3>
<p>If you are new to R and RStudio then first we need to get set up. To install R for your operating system choose the appropriate option <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/">here</a> and install R. Then download the free RStudio desktop for your system <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>.</p>
<p>You should already have knitr installed with RStudio but in the wildly unlikely event that you don’t then run this line.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;knitr&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We will use the development version of rcrossref for reasons we will explain below. You will need devtools (above) installed to do that.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;ropensci/rcrossref&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(knitr)
library(rcrossref)</code></pre>

<h3>Creating A Bibliography File</h3>
<p>One of the puzzling things about getting started with creating bibliographies in RStudio… is how to create a bibliography file. So, as a warm up let’s do that.</p>
<p>Yihui Xie has made it incredibly easy to create a bibliography in <a href="http://www.bibtex.org/">bibtex</a> format with the <a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> package. Let’s create a file that contains packages mentioned in this article. The <code>write_bib()</code> function allows us to add in a vector of package names, and to specify the path and name for the file using <code>file =</code>. In this case I am creating a file called packages.bib in the content section of my blogdown site. I’ll break it up for visibility.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::write_bib(c(&quot;devtools&quot;, &quot;base&quot;, &quot;rcrossref&quot;, &quot;blogdown&quot;, &quot;bookdown&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;,
                   &quot;rmarkdown&quot;, &quot;citr&quot;, &quot;bibtex&quot;), width = 60, 
                 file = &quot;/Users/pauloldham17inch/blog/content/post/packages.bib&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This takes citation information from the description section of the packages. When you run this chunk it is normal to see a bunch of warning messages such as <code>DESCRIPTION file of package ‘ggmap’could not determine year for ‘ggmap’ from package</code> etc.</p>
<p>It is that easy. All we need to do is identify where we want to save the file and then try to remember the packages that we use regularly.</p>
<p>If we take a quick look at the content we will see the following.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>@Manual{R-rcrossref,
  title = {rcrossref: Client for Various &#39;CrossRef&#39; &#39;APIs&#39;},
  author = {Scott Chamberlain and Carl Boettiger and Ted Hart
    and Karthik Ram},
  note = {R package version 0.8.1.9513},
  url = {https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref},
  year = {2018},
}</code></pre>
<p>So now we have an easy way to create a bibliography file, hurrah! Let’s move on to rcrossref.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-rcrossref-addin" class="section level3">
<h3>The rcrossref Addin</h3>
<p>RStudio includes a button at the top of the screen called Addins. It’s here:</p>
<p><img src="/images/rcrossref/addin.gif" width="400px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The standard version of rcrossref includes an addin that allows you to search for references using dois (document identifiers). I’ll come back to that. However, the add in for the development version does more thanks to great work by <a href="https://github.com/haozhu233">Hao Zhu</a> of <a href="https://github.com/haozhu233/giphyr">giphyr</a> fame. In response to a request on github <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref/issues/148">here</a>, Hao Zhu created a new version of the rcrossref addin that we will use now.</p>
<p>From the Addins menu select Add Rcrossref Citations and a panel will open up. In the development version we can type in the name of an article and then Add to My Citations and Done when we are finished as we see in this example. I’ll look up one I can remember.</p>
<p><img src="/images/rcrossref/addarticle.gif" width="800px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can also use document identifiers. Here is one of mine on the completely bonkers subject of global climate engineering or geoengineering with doi: 10.1098/rsta.2014.0065.</p>
<p><img src="/images/rcrossref/doi.gif" width="800px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The rcrossref add in creates a new file in your RStudio project directory (assuming you are using projects which is a very good thing), called crossref.bib. Once this file is created any time that you use the Addin it will add references rather than overwrite the file. So, this can be a very good way to build up a bibliography using rcrossref.</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-citations-in-rmarkdown" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding citations in Rmarkdown</h3>
<p>To add a citation we simply use [@] and the relevant link in the citation, as explained by Yihui <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html">here</a>. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rcrossref <span class="citation">(Chamberlain et al. 2018)</span> is a great package for accessing data for a bibliography or for larger scale bibliometrices. In 2014 Paul Oldham and his co-authors published an article on the completely mad subject of global climate engineering that succeeded in exciting consipiracy theorists using the #contrails and #chemtrails hashtags on twitter <span class="citation">(Oldham et al. 2014)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is ridiculously easy to do.</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-the-bibliography" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding the Bibliography</h3>
<p>We now have two bibliographies, one called packages.bib and one called crossref.bib. To get them to render when we knit the document (or build for blogdown or bookdown users… no knitting please) we need to put them in the header or YAML of the rmarkdown document. In all cases that looks like this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bibliography: [packages.bib, crossref.bib]</code></pre>
<p>When we knit or build the document the citations will show up in the text itself and at the bottom of the document. To mark the start of the bibliography simply create a header such as <code>#References</code> as the final line of your document.</p>
</div>
<div id="going-further" class="section level3">
<h3>Going Further</h3>
<p>Thanks to the team behind <code>rcrossref</code> you now have over 96 million references at your finger tips. Many thankas are also due to Yihui Xie and the team behind <code>knitr</code>, <code>bookdown</code> and <code>blogdown</code> for their really great work</p>
<p>You can read more about bibliographies on the RStudio site <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html">here</a>. Yihui Xie’s <a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr website</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1498716962/ref=cm_sw_su_dp">book</a> are great resources <span class="citation">(Xie 2016a)</span>.</p>
<p>Bookdown users can find more information in the electronic version of the bookdown book right <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html">here</a> <span class="citation">(Xie 2016b)</span>.</p>
<p>For blogdown users: <a href="https://github.com/apreshill">Alison Presmanes Hill</a>, a co-author of blogdown, has written a very useful guide to citations in the minimal blogdown demo <a href="https://github.com/rbind/blogdown-demo/blob/master/content/post/2017-08-28-adding-citations-to-posts.Rmd">here</a> that I used to write this article. It covers subjects such as using <code>nocite:</code> in your YAML to avoid academic style citations for packages in the text. In the references below you will see that there all the packages used are included but without inline citation. You will very probably want to read the excellent blogdown book <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">here</a> as well <span class="citation">(Xie, Thomas, and Hill 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Packages to help you navigate citations include <code>citr</code> and <code>bibtex</code> and you may well want to check them out. If you know of any more please feel welcome to mention them below.</p>
