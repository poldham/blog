```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Create a packages biblio file

```{r cars}
knitr::write_bib(c("placement", "tidyverse", "ggmap", "googleway", "dplyr", "usethis", "devtools", "base", "googleway", "leaflet"), width = 60, file = "/Users/pauloldham17inch/blog/content/post/packages.bib")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
